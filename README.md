# Increased cost-landscape simlarity for QAOA using input scaling 

This repository contains the code for the experimentation on quantum optimization using QAOA. We investigate the impact of input scaling on the cost landscape and optimization performance of QAOA. The code demonstrates how two different distance_matrix inputs produce very similar parameter vs cost plot. 

## Dependencies

This project uses the following packages:

- `qiskit`: For quantum circuit simulation and VQE implementation.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `public-package`: A publicly available package used for [specific functionality].

Make sure you have these packages installed in your Python environment. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib public-package
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd research-project
```

3. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Results

The results of our experiments are available in the `results` folder. See `results/plot.png` for a visualization of the cost landscape with and without input scaling.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the authors of the `public-package` for their valuable contribution to the field. We used version 1.0.0 of the package in our research. Please see [link to package] for more information and the original license.
